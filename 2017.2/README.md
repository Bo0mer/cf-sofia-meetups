### [Do It Yourself Containers]()
**Georgi Sabev**

You have probably heard a lot about containers. But what are they really? Some talk about them as lightweight VMs, others put an equation sign between containers and projects like LXC, Docker and Rocket. It is so confusing! In reality containers are simple. They are built by direct usage of modern linux kernel features and all aforementioned projects are generally doing the same thing while providing a slightly different mental model. If you want to build a container all you really need is a relatively new linux distro on your laptop. Join us to learn what a container is and how to build one by yourself without installing Docker or LXC, even without writing code.
