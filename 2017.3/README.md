### [Resistance Is Futile, Resilience Is Crucial: Distributed Cloud Native Applications with Node.js]()
The speakers will start by going through the pitfalls of microservices and distributed systems, including how you can troubleshoot and solve typical failures. Next, they will present our Node.js toolset including custom networking modules, Hystrix/Eureka/Turbine integration, and the Mozzle/Riemann/Influx/Grafana monitoring stack that help us build, debug, deploy, and monitor their application at scale on Cloud Foundry. Finally, they will outline how neural networks and the new container networking feature could help with operating such applications.

### Pivotal Dojo program: Extreme programming in San Francisco
Dojo is becoming increasingly popular way to learn new stuff these days. But what about doing it to convince Google and Twitter to do agile and extreme programming?
