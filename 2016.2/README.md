# 2016.2

## Agenda

1. [Cloud Foundry History](http://www.slideshare.net/hsiliev/cloud-foundry-history)

   Short journey through the CF history. We'll start in the early days of Twitter & Google, then briefly touch the first AWS Grails automation toolset, and explain how to merge Spring, VSphere and big-data into a single piece of technology. Along the way we'll  decipher lots of TLA (three-letter-acronyms) and ETLA (extended TLA) such as VCAP, DEA and EMC.

2. [Buildpacks: Detect, Compile, Release](http://www.slideshare.net/hsiliev/buildpacks-detect-compile-release)

   We'll start with high-level overview of what's the role of the buildpacks in CF. Then we'll dig deeper to explain what happens when you push an application to highlight the difference between "staging" and "starting". Finally, we'll extend the static buildpack to do simple image manipulation.
